Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jma1991/LPMP_LHF_C/tree/3b9dd2ce299a487b0147f82d7bc5c60f1b9eea9c" target="_blank">3b9dd2c</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/secondary-signalling.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/secondary-signalling.html</code>) files.

<p>Create a CellChat object from a SingleCellExperiment object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cellchat &lt;- createCellChat(object = sce, group.by = &quot;label&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>The `logcounts` assay is used 
The `colData` assay in the SingleCellExperiment object is used as cell meta information 
The cell groups used for CellChat analysis are  1 2 3 4 5 </code></pre>
<p>Set the ligand-receptor interaction database:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cellchat@DB &lt;- CellChatDB.mouse</code></pre>
<p>Subset the expression data of signaling genes for saving computation cost:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cellchat &lt;- subsetData(cellchat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Issue identified!! Please check the official Gene Symbol of the following genes:  
 H2-Q8 H2-T9 H2-T18 H2-Q9 H2-L H2-BI H2-D H60a H2-Ea-ps </code></pre>
<p>Identify over-expressed signaling genes associated with each cell group:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cellchat &lt;- identifyOverExpressedGenes(cellchat)</code></pre>
<p>Identify over-expressed ligand-receptor interactions (pairs) within the used CellChatDB:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cellchat &lt;- identifyOverExpressedInteractions(cellchat)</code></pre>
<p>Project gene expression data onto a protein-protein interaction network:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cellchat &lt;- projectData(cellchat, PPI.mouse)</code></pre>
<p>Compute the communication probability/strength between any interacting cell groups:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cellchat &lt;- computeCommunProb(cellchat)</code></pre>
<p>Compute the communication probability on signaling pathway level by summarizing all related ligands/receptors:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cellchat &lt;- computeCommunProbPathway(cellchat)</code></pre>
<p>Calculate the aggregated network by counting the number of links or summarizing the communication probability:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cellchat &lt;- aggregateNet(cellchat)</code></pre>
<p>Returns a data frame consisting of all the inferred cell-cell communications:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>net &lt;- subsetCommunication(cellchat)</code></pre>

<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Print interactive table of all the inferred cell-cell communications:</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
